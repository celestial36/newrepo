What are the benefits of using version control, especialy Git? 

	Having a GitHub repo makes it easy for you to keep 
track of collaborative and personal projects - all files necessary 
for certain analyses can be held together and people can add in their 
code, graphs, etc. as the projects develop.

One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities. 
Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap 
and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular 
with many Git users. Feature branches provide an isolated environment 
for every change to your codebase.
