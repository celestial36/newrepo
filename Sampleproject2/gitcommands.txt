1. git add

Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. 
This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing 
it to the official history.

2.git branch

This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. 
It lets you create isolated development environments within a single 
repository.

3.git checkout

In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisions, git 
checkout is also the means to navigate existing branches. Combined 
with the basic Git commands, itâ€™s a way to work on a particular line 
of development.
